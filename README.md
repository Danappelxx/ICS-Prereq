# ICS Prerequisites
A simple tool which scrapes prerequisites and displays them in a searchable table. 

It also allows you to list the courses you have taken in order to see which ones you are cleared to take.

I built this for myself so the UX has no polish whatsoever. Live at [prereq.danapp.app](https://prereq.danapp.app).
